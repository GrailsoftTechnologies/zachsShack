					<h1>Zach's Shack Hot Dogs...</h1>
	        <h3>
						...are 100% beef dogs with a natural casing.
            It's the casing and the steaming that gives the dog the "snap".
            You may choose to substitute a tofu dog or veggie sausage (will take 4 minutes longer to prepare) at no extra charge.
            We are open until 2am every night.
            Thanks for stopping by!
